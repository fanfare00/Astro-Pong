AstroPong
=========

Astro Pong was created by James McCarthy for Larry Forman's Spring 2014 CISC
220 Game Programming class. It is a reimagining of the classic game PONG with all
of the same core elements of the original game. Exciting new features include a UFO
that wanders the playing field deflecting both players shots, a star that curves the
fabric of space and time, an AI with adjustable difficulty, and the ability to collect
energy and use it to charge up a powerful aimed shot. The game uses a neon color
palate consisting primarily of orange, blue and pink with a cohesive space theme. All
resources were created by me unless otherwise listed in the MEDIA section below.  

GAME  INSTRUCTIONS
==================
				
Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to move the paddle up and down. Alternatively, you may 
also use the up and down arrow keys or set the controls to the mouse in the
options menu. The first player to score 10 points wins the game. The speed of
the ball increases every time the ball strikes the paddle. Hitting the ball near the
edge of the paddle will increase its angle.

	Hold the SPACE bar to perform a powerful aimed shot. Energy is drained while
	holding SPACE, performing a power shot consumes 50 energy.
	
	UFOs move sporadically around the game field and shots may bounce off the top
	or the bottom of their ship's hull.

	Destroying an asteroid grants +50 energy to be used on power shots.

	Remaining energy is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

	Whenever the ball flys to near to a star, its trajectory may change due to the effects
	of the star's gravity.
